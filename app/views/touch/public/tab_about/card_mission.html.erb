We help your friends help you improve some part of your life.</br>
</br>
How do you do it?</br>
</br>
First, you identify some goal.</br>
</br>
Next you make a commitment to taking a step needed to move towards that goal.</br>
</br>
Then, you identify the friends (and others) who you want to help you to be accountable (your accountability partners).</br>
</br>
Whether you meet your commitment or not, your accountability partners are kept informed.</br>
</br>
This will work with the help of our service or without it. We just make it a little easier.</br>
