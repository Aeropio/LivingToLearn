You will begin moving to your goal in a matter of minutes! Please continue ...</br>
</br>
First, what type of goal do you want to pursue? Do you want an 'A' in Chemistry? Do you want to pray for 5 minutes a day?</br>
</br>
To proceed, register yourself (under User), describe your goal (under Goals), and then make some commitment towards achieving that goal (under commitments).</br>
</br>
Now is the most important part ... invite your friends to help you be accountable (under accountability).</br>
</br>
That's it! As we promised, you will be off and running very soon.
